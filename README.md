# smsspam
In this project I have detected whether the emails are spam or not.
This is a textual dataset so for this I checked and adapted a lot of algorithms.
Naive Bayes gave me very good accuracy and precision in all those algorithms.
Naive bayes also has three algorithms multinomial gaussian and bernoulli whereas me bernoulli gave good accuracy and precision which is 98% accuracy and 100% precision.
which is good for my project
And I have created a website on Streamlit and put one video for spam and one video for not spam.
First I designed the video in canva
